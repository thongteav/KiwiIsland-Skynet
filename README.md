## Git branch use
â€¯After development of each iteration, the team will merge sprint increment with main branch.Team will also keep version control by cloning increment after each iteration so we will have a version backup accroding to the each iteration.

## GIt Team Rules

1. If any team member break the remote GitHub build they have to fix it. 
2. when committing have a sufficient comment to describe the commit. 
3. Each developer will commit every reasonable updates to local branch so we will not lose any development. 
4. Don't force commit to  remote branch unless developer has already communicated the team about it. 
5. When pulling and pushing to remote if there is any conflicts ,identify and compare the files before merging so we don't lose any development.
